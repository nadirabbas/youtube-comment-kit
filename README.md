This repository is for **feedback, bug reports, and feature requests** for the **YouTube Comment Suite** extension.

**Features:**

## Search Tips
Use these operators to get precise results inside the extension:

- **Space = AND**  
  All terms must appear.  
  Example: `apple banana` → finds comments containing *both* words.

- **Pipe `|` = OR**  
  At least one term must appear.  
  Example: `apple|banana` → finds comments containing *either* word.

- **Quotes = Exact phrase**  
  Matches the phrase exactly.  
  Example: `"apple banana"` → finds comments containing that exact phrase.
